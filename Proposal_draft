** Project Description/Outline **
24-Hour Fitness Franchises Still Growing; Is There Still Room For More? 
Which city can be the next? 
Background: https://smallbiztrends.com/2009/02/24-hour-fitness-franchises-still-growing-is-there-still-room-for-more.html



** Research Questions to Answer **
24 hour fitness is a privately owned fitness center chain, opening 24 hours evey day.
As of 2016, only 16 states have gyms by 24 hour fitness.
As 24-hour Gyms seems becoming a demand, we’d like to see what kind of city will be more likely to welcome 24-hour gyms. 
City with young people? With high hourly wage? With more obesity? 
We will review the below data in several metropolitan areas, and then create an index for prediction. 
1.	The ratio of 24 hour fitness gym number  vs. city size/population – scatter chart
2.	24 hour fitness gym number vs. metropolitan expenditure in personal care vs. metropolitan population age – Bubble chart

3.	24 hour fitness gym number vs. income vs. employment rate – bubble chart
https://www.bls.gov/regions/new-york-new-jersey/data/xg-tables/ro2xg02.htm
4.	24 hour fitness gym number vs. non-24 hour gym vs. obesity rate – bar chart 
5.  Population


Risks: 
1.	Need to decide what city to use as baselines. And what cities for prediction 
(16 states with that gym and, and those without)
2.	May need to use web scraping to find out all gym locations
3.  Need to get obesity data, besides the adult obesity rate data.

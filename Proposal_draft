** Project Description/Outline **
24-Hour Fitness Franchises Still Growing; Is There Still Room For More? 
Which city can be the next? 
Background: https://smallbiztrends.com/2009/02/24-hour-fitness-franchises-still-growing-is-there-still-room-for-more.html


** Research Questions to Answer **

As 24-hour Gyms seems becoming a demand, we’d like to see what kind of city will be more likely to welcome 24-hour gyms. 
City with young people? With high hourly wage? With more obesity? 
We will review the below data in several metropolitan areas, and then create an index for prediction. 

1.	The ratio of 24 hour gym number/non-24 hour gym  vs. city size/population – scatter chart 

2.	24 hour gym number vs. metropolitan expenditure in personal care vs. metropolitan population age – Bubble chart

3.	24/7 gym number vs. income vs. employment rate – bubble chart

4.	24 hour gym number vs. non-24 hour gym vs. obesity rate – bar chart 



Risks: 
1.	Need to decide what city to use as baselines. And what cities for prediction 
2.	May need to use web scraping to find out all gym locations  
3.  Need to get obesity data
